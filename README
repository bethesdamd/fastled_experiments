First experiments with FastLED library and a led
strip, using Hiletgo ESP32 and Arduino IDE

IMPORTANT:

In Arduino IDE use Board Manager to select "ESP Dev Module".  There is
no 'board' called Hiletgo, it's just part of a collection of dozens
of similar generic ESP32 boards.

To find port on my mac:

ls /dev/tty* 

Make sure to use a USB cable with data lines.

To confirm that, do the following:

- unplug usb cable
- do /dev/tty*|wc -l and note the output e.g 123
- plug in cable
- repeat above ls command
- if cable is suitable, the count will increment by 1 e.g. to 124
